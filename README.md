# Local setup
## Scenario
- You are working on a project that has many services that you have to deal with like databases,MySQL,Postgres,Apache etc and you may not be comfortable making changes in the realservers so you overcome the problem by setting up a local stack on your local machine by use of virtual machines
- You can set up a local setup that is automated and repeatable

## Tools
- Hypervisor(Oracle VM virtualbox)
- Vagrant(for automation)
- CLI(gitbash)
- An IDE of your choice
